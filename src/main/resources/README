README
------

This application is based on a programming test I did for a job interview in Tokyo, Japan.

I developed this on a Mac Book w/ Mac OS X 10.6 in NetBeans 7 between 2011-11-14 and 2011-11-20.

This application uses serveral source files from the original Google samples for google-api-java-client. 
For more details about the samples please see http://code.google.com/p/google-api-java-client

The original sample code and sample classes I use are in the package de.kurashigegollub.com.google.calender.
The files I modified are as follows:

- CalendarUrl.java
- Entry.java

The rest of my own code is in the package de.kurashigegollub.dev.*.

Other technologies used:
    - Java EE
    - JavaScript
    - CSS
    - HTML
    - git
    - Maven 3 (bundled w/ NetBeans 7)
    - Tomcat 6.0.33
    - Google Client Library for Java (see pom.xml for details)

TODOs:
------

- refactor exception and error handling to be more streamlined
- refactor application flow
- add a html template system, to replace the direct HTML output in the Java classes
  OR
  use JSP/JSF instead
- add unit tests


Problem description is as follows:
----------------------------------

++++++

goal: create a web application to view a gmail user's calendar data,
with the option to forward the calendar data in a mail message

process: application operates as per the following
1 User opens the test application page and on loading, the user's
calender data for the next 2 weeks is retrieved and displayed.

2 Authenticate the user via any Google authentication method, OAuth,
AuthSub, ClientLogin, etc.
(http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/docs/GettingStarted.html)

3 User the Google Calendar API to retrieve user calendar data.
(http://code.google.com/apis/calendar/data/2.0/developers_guide.html)

4 The user can enter 1 or more mail address and click a button to open
a gmail compose window prepopulated with the calendar data.

notes:
- Please create your own gmail account for development.
- The test application should be developed in Java1.6 and run on Tomcat 6.0.
